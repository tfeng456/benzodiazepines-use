[First Place winner for Best Insight](http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/competition/2021-asa-datafesttm-results/) in 2021 ASA UCLA DataFest Competition.

Explored which characteristics of each occupational group (students, health professionals, and veterans) determined the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in a 2018 sample of participants in the United States. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels.

BZDs are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs.

We created three multinomial logistic regression models to predict use/misuse of BZDs for each occupation.
