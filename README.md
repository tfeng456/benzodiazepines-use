[First Place winner for Best Insight](http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/competition/2021-asa-datafesttm-results/) in 2021 ASA UCLA DataFest Competition.

Analysis on which characteristics of each occupation group (students, health professionals, and veterans) determined the use/misuse of Benzodiazepines (BZDs), with the aim to inform and lead to targeted programs to reduce BZD misuse in each occupation.

Data is from a 2018 sample of participants in the United States.

BZDs are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels.

We created three multinomial logistic regression models to predict use/misuse of BZDs for each occupation.
